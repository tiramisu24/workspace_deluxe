<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The Workspace Service (WSS) is primarily a language independent remote storage and retrieval system for KBase typed objects (TO) defined with the KBase Interface Description Language (KIDL). It has the following primary features: - Immutable storage of TOs with - user defined metadata - data provenance - Versioning of TOs - Referencing from TO to TO - Typechecking of all saved objects against a KIDL specification - Collecting typed objects into a workspace - Sharing workspaces with specific KBase users or the world - Freezing and publishing workspaces</p>

        NOTE: In the vast majority of cases, this method is not necessary and
        get_objects should be used instead. 
        
        get_referenced_objects guarantees that a user that has access to an

        and b) objects that are referenced in the object&#39;s provenance. This
        ensures that the user has visibility into the entire provenance of the
        object and the object&#39;s object dependencies (e.g. references).
        
        The user must have at least read access to the first object in each
        reference chain, but need not have access to any further objects in
        the chain, and those objects may be deleted.

A major version of 0 implies that the type is in development and may have backwards incompatible changes from minor version to minor version. Once a type is released, backwards incompatible changes always cause a major version increment. 2) This version of the type becomes the default version, and if a specific version is not supplied in a function call, this version will be used. This means that newer, unreleased versions of the type may be skipped.</p>

<p>An Object Specification (OS). Inherits from ObjectIdentity (OI). Specifies which object, and which parts of that object, to retrieve from the Workspace Service.</p>

<p>The fields wsid, workspace, objid, name, and ver are identical to the OI fields.</p>

<p>The ref field&#39;s behavior is extended from OI. It maintains its previous behavior, but now also can act as a reference string. See reference following below for more information.</p>

<p>REFERENCE FOLLOWING:</p>

<p>Reference following guarantees that a user that has access to an object can always see a) objects that are referenced inside the object and b) objects that are referenced in the object&#39;s provenance. This ensures that the user has visibility into the entire provenance of the object and the object&#39;s object dependencies (e.g. references).</p>

<p>The user must have at least read access to the object specified in this SO, but need not have access to any further objects in the reference chain, and those objects may be deleted.</p>

<p>Optional reference following fields: Note that only one of the following fields may be specified.</p>

<p>ref_chain obj_path - a path to the desired object from the object specified in this OS. In other words, the object specified in this OS is assumed to be accessible to the user, and the objects in the object path represent a chain of references to the desired object at the end of the object path. If the references are all valid, the desired object will be returned. - OR - list&lt;obj_ref&gt; obj_ref_path - shorthand for the obj_path. - OR - ref_chain to_obj_path - identical to obj_path, except that the path is TO the object specified in this OS, rather than from the object. In other words the object specified by wsid/objid/ref etc. is the end of the path, and to_obj_path is the rest of the path. The user must have access to the first object in the to_obj_path. - OR - list&lt;obj_ref&gt; to_obj_ref_path - shorthand for the to_obj_path. - OR - ref_string ref - A string representing a reference path from one object to another. Unlike the previous reference following options, the ref_string represents the ENTIRE path from the source object to the target object. As with the OI object, the ref field may contain a single reference. - OR - boolean find_refence_path - This is the last, slowest, and most expensive resort for getting a referenced object - do not use this method unless the path to the object is unavailable by any other means. Setting the find_refence_path parameter to true means that the workspace service will search through the object reference graph from the object specified in this OS to find an object that 1) the user can access, and 2) has an unbroken reference path to the target object. If the search succeeds, the object will be returned as normal. Note that the search will automatically fail after a certain (but much larger than necessary for the vast majority of cases) number of objects are traversed.</p>

<p>OBJECT SUBSETS:</p>

<p>When selecting a subset of an array in an object, the returned array is compressed to the size of the subset, but the ordering of the array is maintained. For example, if the array stored at the &#39;feature&#39; key of a Genome object has 4000 entries, and the object paths provided are: /feature/7 /feature/3015 /feature/700 The returned feature array will be of length three and the entries will consist, in order, of the 7th, 700th, and 3015th entries of the original array.</p>

<p>Optional object subset fields: list&lt;object_path&gt; included - the portions of the object to include in the object subset. boolean strict_maps - if true, throw an exception if the subset specification traverses a non-existent map key (default false) boolean strict_arrays - if true, throw an exception if the subset specification exceeds the size of an array (default true)</p>

<p>Information about a subaction that is invoked by a provenance action.</p>

<pre><code>        A provenance action (PA) may invoke subactions (SA), e.g. calling a
        separate piece of code, a service, or a script. In most cases these
        calls are the same from PA to PA and so do not need to be listed in
        the provenance since providing information about the PA alone provides
        reproducibility.
        
        In some cases, however, SAs may change over time, such that invoking
        the same PA with the same parameters may produce different results.
        For example, if a PA calls a remote server, that server may be updated
        between a PA invoked on day T and another PA invoked on day T+1.
        
        The SubAction structure allows for specifying information about SAs
        that may dynamically change from PA invocation to PA invocation.
        
        string name - the name of the SA.

<p>A provenance action.</p>

<pre><code>        A provenance action (PA) is an action taken while transforming one data
        object to another. There may be several PAs taken in series. A PA is
        typically running a script, running an api command, etc. All of the
        following fields are optional, but more information provided equates to
        better data provenance.
        
        resolved_ws_objects should never be set by the user; it is set by the
        workspace service when returning data.
        
        On input, only one of the time or epoch may be supplied. Both are
        supplied on output.
        
        The maximum size of the entire provenance object, including all actions,
        is 1MB.
        
        timestamp time - the time the action was started
        epoch epoch - the time the action was started.
        string caller - the name or id of the invoker of this provenance
                action. In most cases, this will be the same for all PAs.
        string service - the name of the service that performed this action.
        string service_ver - the version of the service that performed this action.
        string method - the method of the service that performed this action.
        list&lt;UnspecifiedObject&gt; method_params - the parameters of the method
                that performed this action. If an object in the parameters is a
                workspace object, also put the object reference in the
                input_ws_object list.
        string script - the name of the script that performed this action.
        string script_ver - the version of the script that performed this action.
        string script_command_line - the command line provided to the script
                that performed this action. If workspace objects were provided in
                the command line, also put the object reference in the
                input_ws_object list.
        list&lt;ref_string&gt; input_ws_objects - the workspace objects that
                were used as input to this action; typically these will also be
                present as parts of the method_params or the script_command_line
                arguments. A reference path into the object graph may be supplied.
        list&lt;obj_ref&gt; resolved_ws_objects - the workspace objects ids from 
                input_ws_objects resolved to permanent workspace object references
                by the workspace service.
        list&lt;string&gt; intermediate_incoming - if the previous action produced 
                output that 1) was not stored in a referrable way, and 2) is
                used as input for this action, provide it with an arbitrary and
                unique ID here, in the order of the input arguments to this action.
                These IDs can be used in the method_params argument.
        list&lt;string&gt; intermediate_outgoing - if this action produced output
                that 1) was not stored in a referrable way, and 2) is
                used as input for the next action, provide it with an arbitrary and
                unique ID here, in the order of the output values from this action.
                These IDs can be used in the intermediate_incoming argument in the
                next action.
        list&lt;ExternalDataUnit&gt; external_data - data external to the workspace
                that was either imported to the workspace or used to create a
                workspace object.
        list&lt;SubAction&gt; subactions - the subactions taken as a part of this
                action.
        mapping&lt;string, string&gt; custom - user definable custom provenance
                fields and their values.

        typespec spec - the new typespec to register.
        modulename mod - the module to recompile with updated options (see below).
        
        Optional arguments:
        boolean dryrun - Return, but do not save, the results of compiling the 
                spec. Default true. Set to false for making permanent changes.
        list&lt;typename&gt; new_types - types in the spec to make available in the
                workspace service. When compiling a spec for the first time, if
                this argument is empty no types will be made available. Previously
                available types remain so upon recompilation of a spec or
                compilation of a new spec.
        list&lt;typename&gt; remove_types - no longer make these types available in
                the workspace service for the new version of the spec. This does
                not remove versions of types previously compiled.
        mapping&lt;modulename, spec_version&gt; dependencies - By default, the
                latest released versions of spec dependencies will be included when
                compiling a spec. Specific versions can be specified here.
        spec_version prev_ver - the id of the previous version of the typespec.
                An error will be thrown if this is set and prev_ver is not the
                most recent version of the typespec. This prevents overwriting of
                changes made since retrieving a spec and compiling an edited spec.
